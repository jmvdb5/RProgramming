# Step 1 #

# Packages
require(pryr)
require(ISLR)
require(boot)
library(data.table)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)

# Read data
data <- read.table("Assignment 6 Dataset.txt", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
data
StudentAverage <- ddply(data,"Sex",transform,Grade.Average=mean(Grade))

# By making another variable, SexBinary, we can now take the mean of the sexes
data$SexBinary <- ifelse(data$Sex == "Male", 1, 0)

# Finding the mean, Closer to 0 means more female, 1 means more male
sex = data$SexBinary
mean(sex)



# Step 2 #

# Write names with an I to a new data frame
i_names <- data[grep("i", data$Name), ]

# Write those names to a csv file
write.csv(i_names$Name, file = "i_names.csv", row.names = FALSE)



# Step 3 #

# Write the data frame to a csv
write.csv(data, file = "data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
